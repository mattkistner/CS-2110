 * Part 1 - Coding a bit vector

 *
 * Global rules for this file:
 * - You may not use multiplication, division or modulus in any method.
 * - You may not use more than 2 conditionals per method, and you may only use
 *   them in select methods. Conditionals are if-statements, if-else statements,
 *   or ternary expressions. The else block associated with an if-statement does
 *   not count toward this sum.
 * - You may not use looping constructs in most methods. Looping constructs
 *   include for loops, while loops and do-while loops. See below for exceptions
 * - In those methods that allow looping, you may not use more than 2 looping
 *   constructs, and they may not be nested.
 * - You may not declare any file-level variables.
 * - You may not declare any objects.
 * - You may not use switch statements.
 * - You may not use casting.
 * - You may not use the unsigned right shift operator (>>>)
 * - You may not write any helper methods, or call any method from this or
 *   another file to implement any method. Recursive solutions are not
 *   permitted.
 * - You may only perform addition or subtraction with the number 1.
 *
 * Method-specific rules for this file:
 * - All methods must be done in one line, except for: zerosCount, onesCount,
 *   and size.
 * - Looping and conditionals as described above are only allowed for:
 *   zerosCount, onesCount, and size
 * - You can only use addition and subtraction in: zerosCount, onesCount, and
 *   size
